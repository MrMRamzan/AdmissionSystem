<b>Case Study:</b><br>
An enterprise of professionals has the department of procurement which serves company
employees with different accessories including laptop, pen, note book, sticky notes and
everything which an employee needs to fulfill his job. All the record of accessories to be
provided to the employees is managed by a single person (we can refer him as accessories
manager) whose responsibilities are as follow:<br>
* Maintain the record of employees who come to him for issuance of different things.
He does not need any extra biodata of employees except their name, email and cell
number.<br>
* When accessories manager receives accessories, he has to update the count of each
accessory under different categories for which he has dedicated different manual
registers against each category.<br>
* When an employee comes for issuance of accessories to accessories manager, he
again updates for all the things for which employees has demanded. For example, an
employee took one pen, one notebook and a staple, Accessories manager will keep
record of each thing issued against that employee.<br>
* When accessories manager issues any thing to an employee, he writes a receipt and
take signatures of employee on that receipt.<br>
In the modern era of computers where every thing is digitized, We need to reduce the manual
efforts of accessories manager by providing an application which will provide user interface
to perform all the above tasks.<br>
You are required to develop an application in C#.NET which should include UI for above
mentioned application. We donâ€™t need to persist data in files or database. We just need to
save data in main memory so that as far as application is running, data is there.
Good UI and better software design(you are already done with software engineering) is a plus
and will ultimately help you to get bonus credit.
